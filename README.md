# Validating Feature Importances & ML Models

## Overview
This repository contains the essential files for a project validating various feature importance metrics derived from the Ames, Iowa real estate dataset. See below for links to the blog post and video presentation for a more in depth understanding of the research and findings. 

## Contents
- 'AMES_Maps_KNNLocations.ipynb': geospatial analysis and clustering of home locations
- `EDA1.ipynb`: general dataset EDA to clean data, remove reduntant features, etc. 
- `ML_models_RF&XGB.ipynb`: initial modeling of the data with random forest and XGBoost using all features.
- 'ames_neighborhoods_map.html':  html map of Ames neighborhoods for use in my blog post
- `dim_reduction_pca.ipynb`: use of PCA to reduce featurest (didn't use this method).
- 'dimreduced_XGB_RF.ipynb': full modeling with reduced dimensions datasets including feature importance metrics validation.

## Additional Resources
For those interested in the detailed datasets, additional analysis notebooks, or other resources used in this project, they are available upon request. These materials are helpful for anyone looking to replicate the analysis or explore the methodologies applied in further detail.
